# User Profiles
### Understanding Services with $q
Now returning to our project where we are pulling user profiles, we've made some good progress. We can now make real life API requests for data using $http (AJAX requests)!

But what happens if we want to have a bit more granular control over our code. Sometimes you'll want to manipulate your data before you send it over to the controller. That's where $q comes into play!

$q allows us to hold off on sending our data over until we're ready. It's fairly simple. All we need to do is edit our service.

## Step 1 Our Service
- Inject $q into the service
``` javascript
angular.module('userProfiles').service('mainService', function($http, $q) {
  this.getUsers = function() {
    return $http({
        method: 'GET',
        url: 'http://reqres.in/api/users?page=1'
    })
  }
});
```

- Once injected we can begin using it by adding a deferred variable to handle it

``` javascript
angular.module('userProfiles').service('mainService', function($http, $q) {
  this.getUsers = function() {
    var deferred = $q.defer();
    return $http({
        method: 'GET',
        url: 'http://reqres.in/api/users?page=1'
    })
  }
});
```

- Now let's add a promise to our service

``` javascript
angular.module('userProfiles').service('mainService', function($http, $q) {
  this.getUsers = function() {
    var deferred = $q.defer();
    $http({
        method: 'GET',
        url: 'http://reqres.in/api/users?page=1'
    }).then(function(response) {
      deferred.resolve(response)
    })
    return deferred.promise;
  }
});
```

Right now, our code should still work the same, so what's the point of $q? Why are we adding all of this weird code to our service?

Well imagine you wanted to make a change to your data before you sent it over to the controller. For instance, currently we have this happening in our controller:

``` javascript
mainService.getUsers().then(function(dataFromService) {
  $scope.users = dataFromService.data.data;
});
```

dataFromService.data.data??? We are loading a lot of unnecessary data into our $scope object. Rather than filter it out in our controller we can use $q to filter it out as we pull it through our service.

``` javascript
angular.module('userProfiles').service('mainService', function($http, $q) {
  this.getUsers = function() {
    var deferred = $q.defer();
    $http({
        method: 'GET',
        url: 'http://reqres.in/api/users?page=1'
    }).then(function(response) {
      var parsedResponse = response.data.data
      deferred.resolve(parsedResponse)
    })
    return deferred.promise;
  }
});
```

Now our controller can just take what it's given and not have to filter anything out. Like so:

``` javascript
angular.module('userProfiles').controller('MainController', function($scope, mainService) {
  $scope.getUsers = function() {
    mainService.getUsers().then(function(dataFromService) {
      $scope.users = dataFromService;
    });
  }

  $scope.getUsers();

});
```

Cool stuff!

Let's go ahead and do something a little less relevant, but more fun. Let's change everyones first_name in the service to Ralf.

``` javascript
angular.module('userProfiles').service('mainService', function($http, $q) {
  this.getUsers = function() {
    var deferred = $q.defer();
    $http({
        method: 'GET',
        url: 'http://reqres.in/api/users?page=1'
    }).then(function(response) {
      var parsedResponse = response.data.data
      for(var i = 0; i < parsedResponse.length; i++) {
        parsedResponse[i].first_name = 'Ralf'
      }
      deferred.resolve(parsedResponse)
    })
    return deferred.promise;
  }
});
```

Now all of our user's first names are Ralf. While it isn't a very good real world example, it's good to see how we can manipulate things. $q!
